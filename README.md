#### Built under a MIT General Public License      
*To be *very* clear, the only code I wrote for this project will be found within the web folder and inside the map.rs file.


### Other software contributions
* Web framework with:
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  * HTML
    * NOTE: the framework is very simplistic and doesn't interface with the server yet but can be ran to see 
    an example of the layout we were thinking of providing to the users. 
* Kruskal's minimum-spanning-tree algorithm  
  * Was used to build a connected tree with the fewest edges of the least weight for every system in EVE.
    * NOTE: this algorithm didn't work as intended; due to, a the algorithm not being robust enough to produce a path from the tree. Currently path_generator.py is providing a simple dijstra path from one system to another using networkx python3 library.
     
## Build and install
* Once the repository is downloaded, make sure you've installed sqlite3, python3 or greater, and networkx. 
* run the updateDB.py by using "python3 updateDB.py" to update the databse. Script will continually run and print to screen when data is updated. 
* While updateDB.py is running, run "python3 path_generator.py 'sys_from' sys_to'". 
* Ex "python3 path_generator.py Amarr Jita" will return the shortest path with no kills from Amarr to Jita and print them to screen. 
* The independent .html files can be run locally produce a web page--unfortunatley we were not able to get a web service up and running. 


The files used in this project are Python3.6 with Networkx library, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, while using JSON files for formatted input.

## Acknowledgments
